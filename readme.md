## Installation

Feel free to clone the repository anywhere on your computer.

__Node__

First you need to get [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) onto your machine. You can use a simple `sudo apt-get install npm` if you are a Linux user.

__Dependencies__

Open up your console and `cd` in the repository directory. Run `npm install` and wait for the dependencies to be installed. Then run the `gulp` command so all the source files can compile.

__Environment__

Perform a simple `cp .env.example .env` and rewrite the `SLACK_API_TOKEN` variable with your own bot token.

__Up__ and running

All that is left to do now is to run a single `node .` command and you are good to go.

## Features

None noteworthy, for now.

## Contribution

Feel free to fork this repository and contribute via PRs. I will update the contribution guide ASAP.
